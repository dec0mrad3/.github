## Policy

If we verify a reported security vulnerability, our policy is:

- We will patch the current release branch, as well as the immediate prior minor
  release branch.

- After patching the release branches, we will immediately issue new security
  fix releases for each patched release branch.

- A security advisory will be released on the project website detailing the
  vulnerability, as well as recommendations for end-users to protect themselves.
  Security advisories will be listed at [Security Advisories Â· dec0mrad3/logging-log4j2 (github.com)](https://github.com/dec0mrad3/logging-log4j2/security/advisories).

## Preferred Languages
We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Disclosure Guidelines
We hope that you contact us via the email address above and give the
project contributors a chance to resolve the vulnerability and issue a new
release prior to any public exposure; this helps protect the project's
users, and provides them with a chance to upgrade and/or update in order to
protect their applications.
